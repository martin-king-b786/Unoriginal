Johnny Cash,
I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel.,
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real.,
The needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting.,
Tried to kill it all away
but I remember everything.,
What have I become
my sweetest friend?,
Everyone I know goes away in the end.,
And you can have it all;
my empire of dirt.,
I will let you down
I will make you hurt.,
I wear this crown of thorns
upon my liars chair.,
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair.,
Beneath the stains of time
the feelings dissappear.,
You are someone else
I am still right here.,
What have I become
my sweetest friend?,
Everyone I know goes away in the end.,
And you could have it all;
my empire of dirt.,
I will let you down
I will make you hurt.,
If I could start again
a million miles away.,
I would heed myself
I would find a way.
