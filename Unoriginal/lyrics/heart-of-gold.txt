Johnny Cash,
I wanna live
I wanna give,
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.,
It's these expressions I never give
that keeps me searching for a heart of gold
and I'm getting old.,
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
and I'm getting old.,
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I'd cross the ocean for a heart of gold.,
I've been in my mind
it's such a fine line
that keeps me searching for a heart of gold
and I'm getting old.,
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold,
and I'm getting old.,
You keep me searching for a heart of gold
been a miner for a heart of gold
and I'm getting old.
