Smash Mouth,
Somebody once told me; "The world is gonna roll me";
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.,
She was looking kinda dumb with finger and her thumb 
in the shape of an L on her forehead.,
Well
the years start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.,
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.,
So much to do so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the backstreets?,
You'll never know if you don't go
you'll never shine if you don't glow.,
Hey now your an allstar
get your game on go play.,
Hey now you're a rockstar
get the show on get paid.,
All that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mould.,
