Skillet,
I remember when we used to laugh
about nothing at all; it was better than going mad,
From trying to solve all the problems we're going through
forget 'em all,
'Cause on those nights we would stand and never fall
together we faced it all remember when we'd,
Stay up late and we talk all night 
in a dark room lit by the tv light.,
For all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Listen to the radio play all night
didn't want to go home to another fight.,
Through all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
I remember when we used to drive
anywhere but here as long as we'd forget our lives.,
We were so young and confused that we didn't know to laugh or cry
those nights were ours; they will live and never die.,
Together we stand forever
remember when we'd,
Stay up late and we talk all night 
in a dark room lit by the tv light.,
For all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Listen to the radio play all night
didn't want to go home to another fight.,
Through all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Those nights belong to us
there's nothing wrong with us
Those nights belong to us,
I remember when we used to laugh
and now I wish those nights would last.,
Stay up late and we talk all night 
in a dark room lit by the tv light.,
For all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Listen to the radio play all night
didn't want to go home to another fight.,
Through all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Stay up late and we talk all night 
in a dark room lit by the tv light.,
For all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Listen to the radio play all night
didn't want to go home to another fight.,
Through all the hard times in my life
those nights kept me alive.,
Those nights belong to us
there's nothing wrong.
